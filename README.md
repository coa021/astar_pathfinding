# AStar pathfinding

My attempt to create pathfinding.

Sources: 
* [AStar Pathfinding for beginners by Patric Lester](https://csis.pace.edu/~benjamin/teaching/cs627/webfiles/Astar.pdf)

Currently I did basic test in console to see if algorithm works. It does give correct path, I did not do any optimization though.
Future plans:
* Convert syntax to modern C++, - [x] (I guess i did good job)
* Create visual representation with SDL2 or something like that,
* Implement this with Arduino robot so it can calculate its own path on some grid and move on it.
